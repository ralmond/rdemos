# Finding the population mean.

Suppose we are trying to find out the mean of a certain population, $\mu$.  For example, suppose we are interested in the game _eRebuild_ (https://mileresearch.coe.fsu.edu/erebuild) which aims to teach middle school students mathematics.  Here $\mu$ would be how much a math a middle school student learns by playing the game.  That is our target of inference.

We will make three simplifying assumptions:

* We can measure "math"
